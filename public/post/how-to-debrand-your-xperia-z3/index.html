    how to debrand your xperia z3

</div>

            <div class="markdown">
                <p>When I got myself a new Z3 the other day, it had a T-Mobile software branding. I think, you know, what that means: stupid bloatware and less chance to get updates. So I decided to get rid of it. That’s how you do it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do a back up of your data!</li>
<li>Get and install the <a href="http://support.sonymobile.com/global-en/tools/pc-companion/">Sony PC Companion</a>, if you don’t already did.</li>
<li>Get and install <a href="http://www.flashtool.net/downloads.php">Flashtool</a>. I recommend to use the torrent link, because the download server was quite slow, when I tried it.</li>
<li>Get your firmware

<ol>
<li>Start Flashtool and click the button on the right of the toolbar, labeled XF. A new window should open.</li>
<li>In the list on the left, look out for the Xperia Z3/Z3v and choose your model. In the middle, you should know see a new list.</li>
<li>Choose the correct firmware. It’s the one, where the “market” coloumn is the country, you live in and the “operator” looks something like this: “Customized XX”</li>
<li>Now, there are different versions listed on the right coloumn of the window. For example: “23.4.A.1.264 / R7C”. The top one is the newest one. Click on it.</li>
<li>In the new window, just click download. This could take a few minutes.</li>
<li>If it has finished, you are ready to flash the new firmware.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Flash your firmware.

<ol>
<li>Activate the developer options on your Z3.

<ol>
<li>In your settings, go to “About phone”</li>
<li>Click several times on the entry called “Build number” until you get a toast message: “You are now a developer”</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Activate USB debugging in the new entry “Developer options” in your setting. It’s right above “About phone”.</li>
<li>Connect your phone with your PC and allow USB debugging in the dialog, which should pop up on your phone, when it’s connected.</li>
<li>In Flashtool, click now on the button with the lightning on the left. Choose Flashmode. Choose your previously downloaded firmware image in the list on the left. Now click “Flash”</li>
<li>Activate your phones flashmode.

<ol>
<li>Disconnect your device from the PC.</li>
<li>Shut your device down.</li>
<li>While pressing volume down, reconnect your device.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Flashtool starts flashing. This could take some time.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Reboot your phone and have fun with an debranded Z3!</li>
</ol>

<p>I think this could also work with other Xperia phones, for example the Z3 compact, but I didn’t test it. It could also be possible, to flash another countries firmware to your model, but I didn’t test it neither.</p>
