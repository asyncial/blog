This blog documents my adventures in technology. At the moment my primary interest lies is linux/unix systems, their usage, their customization, their history and philosophy. But I am interested in other fields too, such as hardware, robotics, A.I., gaming and more. I hope you will enjoy this blog.

## whoami

I am a computer science student. I like (in no particular order) *NIX, minimalism, the GPL, AMD, Sony, Deus Ex, Risen, XCOM and Civilization, [i3-gaps][9], the Raspberry Pi, [Alpine Linux][10] and more, what I don’t recall at the moment.

## Software I use and recommend

### Webbrowser

* [Vivaldi][13] \- My main browser. Very customizable and integrates excellent tab management. Completely controllable with your keyboard, if you want to.
* [Opera][14] \- My main browser on my phone, but the desktop browser integrates some pretty nice functionality. Sometimes very innovative features.
* [Firefox][15] \- If some site isn’t compatible with vivaldi or someone else is using my laptop. Plus the newest Rust-Addition look pretty interesting.

### Terminal Environment

* [urxvt][16] \- Pretty standard. Customizable through your .Xresources, which is nice.
* [zsh][17] \- Not the most minimalistic, but the most comfortable for me.

### Communication

* [Thunderbird][18] \- Again, pretty standard, but GPG handling with Enigmail is just so convinient.
* [mcabber][19] \- Nice XMPP/Jabber Client for the terminal. Has support for OTR.
* [qTox][20] \- The Tox client, that comes across the most stable and reliable.
* [WhatsApp][21] \- You know it. But I actually think, it is a really good and secure messenger.
* [Signal][22] \- If you want to use a securely encrypted messenger use this one. Not that Telegram crap.
* [Silence][23] \- If you need encrypted SMS
* [K9-Mail][24] \- The android-mail-client that is opensource

### Entertainment

* [Foobar2000][25] \- The music-player I loved. The reason, I changed to Linux like a year later, because I didn’t found a replacement.
* [Deadbeef][26] \- Foobar2000 for Linux. Not as customizable as the original, but it is alright.
* [mpv][27] \- Lightweight video player.
* [Poweramp][28] \- Best android music app. Hands down.

### Work

* [LibreOffice][29] \- Standard. Don’t use OpenOffice, it has almost no active maintainers anymore.
* [IntelliJ IDEA][30] \- We're supposed to program Java in university. This is the best IDE I found.
* [NeoVim][31] \- I am not settled on this one. I like it so far, in fact I am using it to write down these lines, but emacs or [Lime Text][32] are not out of the game.
* [qpdfview][33] \- PDF readers for linux suck. This is the least sucky, I found so far.
* [GIMP][34] \- Edit pictures.
* [Krita][https://krita.org/] \- A very nice application for digital painting, animating stuff and more.

### Desktop

* [i3-gaps][9] \- My window manager. Didn’t find a better one yet. Really nice, when configured properly.
* [polybar][35] \- A nice bar for your DIY Desktop Environment.
* [rofi][36] \- Rice-able application launcher.
* [dunst][37] \- Your new, lightweight notification daemon.
* [Budgie][38] \- A nice, no bullshit Desktop Environment based on the GNOME applications. It is really nice and I like the communication of the developers.
* [KDE][39] \- Fully featured, highly customizable Desktop Environment.

### Linux Distributions

* [Alpine Linux][10] \- Impressive, extremely minimalistic Distribution. Perfect for one purpose projects. Also security-hardened. I might even use it as a desktop distro in the future.
* [Arch Linux][40] \- Distro, that puts you in control. Not perfect, but for me, it is the best compromise between my idealism and my need for a reliable operating system.
* [Solus][41] \- Highly optimized, very good assembled distro. It is suitable for newcomers and it makes some effort to give the users a good experience with steam and games. I think their developer blog is interesting and I really like Budgie, but if you want to customize your system beyond Budgie or MATE the package repositories are a bit lacking.
* [OpenSUSE Leap][42] \- Very stable and polished distribution. It is the one, I usually recommend linux newcomers. It is a solid base, but gives you the possibility to explore the system, if you want to. It’s not dumbed down, like Ubuntu, but gives you the linux feel without needing you to be a technology enthusiast.
* [Puppy][43] \- The most reliable live distro I found so far. I use, if I broke on of my operating systems.
* [SliTaz][44] \- The best lightweight distro, which ships a graphical desktop. At least for me.
