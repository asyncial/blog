I come across a lot of material to learn about computers, porgramming, software etc. on the Internet. Sadly more than I could possibly read... However I think learning and teaching are integral parts of being a hacker in the classical way. On this page I want to share articles, books, videos, wikis and talks that helped me or were interesting in some way to me and are of no cost.
